# **Website Portfolio** #
 

## Description ##
My website Portfolio is the first draft of what will become my future professional portfolio. This project allowed me to delve into HTML and CSS coding to build the template from nothing. It was challenging to not have a shell to work with, but it forced me to use my resources as well as my peers. I now feel a little more comfortable going forward with two of the core technologies for building Web pages. I struggled with media queries and flex properties, but pushed myself to use them to the best of my ability. I look forward to better drafts to come and becoming more fluent in CSS among other subjects in the web development world!
